<p class="chap-title"><a id="chapter1" ></a>CHAPTER 1: KEY CONCEPTS OF SERVICE MANAGEMENT</p>
<p class="noindent">We&#8217;re going to start by taking a look at what service management actually means. Service management describes a way of working within an organisation that helps to deliver value to the organisation&#8217;s customers, so it is worth spending time analysing its definition, along with some of the related concepts.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch01a"></a><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Why is service management important?</p>
<p class="noindent">In today&#8217;s world, information technology (IT) is a fully integrated part of everyone&#8217;s life. Whether using a smartphone, withdrawing cash from an ATM, paying bills, or booking tickets on the Internet, IT is present in everything we do. It often plays a supporting role, so we don&#8217;t even think about what we are using until it stops working.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the modern business organisation, we see the same reliance on IT and IT-enabled services. Every department, from finance and customer services through to logistics, relies on IT to carry out its role effectively and efficiently. Effectiveness refers to whether IT is able to achieve its objectives. Efficiency refers to whether IT uses an appropriate amount of resources. An efficient IT organisation will use optimal amounts of time, money, staff, etc.</p>
<p class="noindent">Now, more than ever, organisations need effective and efficient IT to survive. IT supports critical business processes that generate revenue, serve customers and allow business goals to be achieved. At the same time, the IT department or IT organisation is under more and more pressure to deliver better services, often at a reduced cost. It needs to find a balance between supply and demand, service cost and service quality.</p>
<p class="noindent">To make sure that IT can support business objectives properly, organisations need service management. Service management makes sure that the IT-enabled services delivered do what the business needs, when the business needs it.</p>
<p class="noindent">With effective support and good-quality IT-enabled services, organisations can adopt bold strategies, including the expansion of existing services and movement into new markets. With poor-quality services, organisations will struggle to deliver what they do now, let alone expand and offer anything new or exciting. Now, when many organisations are adopting a strategy focused on &#8216;digital transformation&#8217;, this topic becomes even more relevant.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch01b"></a><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Why use ITIL&#174; for service management?</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worthwhile asking &#8216;what is ITIL and why is it important?&#8217; ITIL is considered best practice for IT service management (ITSM). It was originally developed by the UK government, and is now adopted by many organisations in both the public and private sectors globally.</p>
<p class="noindent">ITIL is not a prescriptive standard that must be followed. It does not say what must be done in a service provider organisation, and there is no certificate or award for successfully adopting ITIL in an organisation. Instead, ITIL is a framework that organisations can adopt and adapt to improve the way they deliver their IT-enabled services.</p>
<p class="noindent">ITIL is a widely recognised source of best practice. It supports organisations as they deliver services that meet their customers&#8217; needs, at a price the customer is willing to pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">In today&#8217;s economic climate, organisations cannot afford to stand still. They need to review their performance and compare it to their competitors and make sure they are improving constantly. Using best practice available in the public domain can support internal improvement.</p>
<p class="noindent">This thinking doesn&#8217;t just apply to the private sector. Public- sector organisations, such as local and central government departments, also need to demonstrate that they offer quality services and value for money. They might not be measured on profit, but there will be service objectives that they have to meet.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch01c"></a><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>A brief history of ITIL</p>
<p class="noindent">ITIL was developed by the UK government in the 1980s to help improve the quality of IT-enabled services and IT projects. The Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA, later renamed the Office of Government Commerce) was tasked with developing a framework for efficient and financially responsible use of IT resources in a government environment.</p>
<p class="noindent">The earliest version of ITIL was called the Government Information Technology Infrastructure Management (GITIM). GITIM focused on service support and service delivery, but was very different from the current version of ITIL. Large companies and government agencies started to adopt ITIL, spreading service management practices across the globe.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2000, Microsoft&#174; used ITIL to develop the Microsoft Operations Framework. In 2001, version 2 of ITIL was released, with training based on the Service Support and Service Delivery core publications. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world took ITIL training and achieved certification to help them manage IT-enabled services and environments, and progress in their ITSM careers.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2007, version 3 of ITIL was released, with an update to v3 in 2011. ITIL v3 was based around a service lifecycle that included:</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Service strategy</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Service design</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Service transition</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Service operation</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Continual service improvement</p>
<p class="noindent">The newest ITIL version is ITIL 4. Released in 2019, ITIL 4 has evolved to a value system-focused approach that can be integrated with other management practices and ways of working, such as Agile and DevOps.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch01d"></a><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Why has ITIL been successful?</p>
<p class="noindent">ITIL is not academic and theoretical. It is based on the experience of ITSM practitioners and offers a practical approach that has evolved over many years. The introduction of a value system-focus in ITIL 4 means that organisations must concentrate less on technology and more on how to co- create value with either internal or external customers. Common processes and practices and a strong service management framework all help to support the focus on value.</p>
<p class="noindent">ITIL is successful because it is:</p>
<p class="blista2"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span><b>Vendor neutral:</b> ITIL is not linked to one supplier, or one technology, or one industry. This means it can be adopted across all types and sizes of organisation.</p>
<p class="blista2"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span><b>Non-prescriptive:</b> Organisations need to adopt and adapt the elements of ITIL that work for them and their customers.</p>
<p class="blista2"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span><b>Best practice:</b> ITIL draws on experience from service management practitioners across the globe.</p>
<p class="noindent">Best practice simply means:</p>
<p class="block">Proven activities or processes that have been successfully used in multiple organizations.<sup><a id="fn1"></a><a href="#fn1-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="noindent">ITIL is seen as being preferable to the proprietary knowledge that builds up inside organisations and the minds of staff members. Proprietary knowledge isn&#8217;t usually documented in a consistent way. It exists because it has built up over time. This means it is not challenged or improved &#8211; and can create a real risk if an experienced staff member leaves and takes their proprietary knowledge with them.</p>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we&#8217;re going to take a look at some of the key concepts related to service management.</p>

<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch01e"></a><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Value</p>
<p class="noindent">Products and services need to add value to consumers to be successful. Value is &#8220;<i>the perceived benefits, usefulness and importance of something</i>&#8221;.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some products and services are directly purchased by consumers, such as bank accounts and mobile phones. If a consumer doesn&#8217;t feel they are receiving value, the service provider organisation will know very quickly because the consumer will choose a different product or service, probably from a rival organisation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where the service relationship is defined less clearly, the service provider organisation might have to work harder to find out if their consumers feel that they are receiving value. For example, the television package that you pay for might include a news channel that you don&#8217;t watch because you feel it&#8217;s biased, so you consume news via the Internet instead. Because you still purchase the package, it&#8217;s more difficult for your service provider to measure this and identify an improvement opportunity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Value encompasses more than just &#8216;value for money&#8217;. Some products and services are more expensive than others, but consumers choose them because they save time or convey status. Service provider organisations need to understand what it is that consumers value about their products and</p>
<p class="noindent">services. Services also need to create value for the service provider, to allow them to continue to provide the service in the future.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch01f"></a><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Service management</p>
<p class="noindent">Services deliver <b>value</b> to consumers. If a service isn&#8217;t carefully managed, the value might be less or might not be delivered at all. An IT-enabled service needs to be measured, monitored and maintained to continue working effectively. An IT organisation can&#8217;t just put a service into the live environment and forget about it.</p>
<p class="noindent">ITIL provides good practices for managing IT-enabled services. It doesn&#8217;t matter what job you have in IT; your role is part of the overall service that is being offered to the consumer.</p>
<p class="noindent">Most modern organisations rely on IT to be effective. They expect IT to be available and responsive, and communicate with them regularly. Technology alone does not deliver a good service. Technology needs to be managed to meet the customer&#8217;s needs. The need for a more holistic approach to IT-enabled services is reflected in the four dimensions of service management described in the ITIL 4 guidance.</p>
<p class="noindent">The definition of service management is:</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;<i>A set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling value for customers in the form of services</i>&#8221;.</p>
<p class="noindent">Capabilities refer to the ability of an organisation to carry out a task or activity. The more mature the organisation, the better its capabilities should be. Capabilities will be based on an organisation&#8217;s experience of customers, processes, services, tools, market conditions, etc. This experience</p>
<p class="noindent">grows over time. Where an organisation has low or immature capabilities, it may choose to source capabilities from an external organisation.</p>
<p class="noindent">An organisation can only develop these specialised organisational capabilities when it understands:</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>The nature of value;</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>The nature and scope of the stakeholders involved; and</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>How value creation is enabled through services.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch01g"></a><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Service management as a professional practice</p>
<p class="noindent">Service management should be viewed as a professional practice. It is supported by an extensive body of knowledge, experience and skills that has built up as the IT industry matured and developed a service focus.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a global community of professionals that supports service management, including organisations like the IT Service Management Forum. You can read more about the itSMF at <a href="http://www.itsmfi.org"><i>www.itsmfi.org</i></a>, including learning about your national chapter and any resources that are available to support you. The itSMF allows service management practitioners to connect with each other and share feedback, ideas and experiences.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ITIL service management framework is supported by a scheme that provides quality assured education, training and certification. There are also other related training and certification schemes, covering areas such as project management, change management, business analysis, and service integration and management.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition, there is a wealth of service management information available &#8211; including academic research and</p>
<p class="noindent">formal standards related to services and service management, such as ISO/IEC 20000, as well as blogs, forums and other more informal content.</p>
<p class="noindent">Service management has developed as IT&#8217;s focus has moved from a technology-centric approach to an end-to-end service and value-based approach. The ITIL 4 approach focuses on the consumer and the quality of service the consumer receives. IT is increasingly seen as a vital business enabler, and IT plans must be aligned to overall business models, strategies and plans.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another factor that has contributed to the advancement and development of service management is the increasing complexity of service delivery. More and more organisations are using shared services or have outsourced some or all IT provision to external organisations. As the number of stakeholders involved with service delivery increases, more sophisticated service management is required to control them. As supply chains get more complex, service management practices need to adapt. The increased complexity of delivery has strengthened and improved service management, as well as imposing greater challenges.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch01h"></a><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Organisation</p>
<p class="noindent">Organisations facilitate value creation. The definition of an organisation is:</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;<i>A person or a group of people that has its own functions with responsibilities, authorities, and relationships to achieve its objectives&#8221;</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent">An organisation could be:</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>A single person;</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>A team within an organisation;</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>A legal entity (a company, or a charity); or</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>A government department or public-sector body.</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that an organisation can be a single person &#8211; for example, a sole trader. Within this definition, an organisation does not have to be a legal entity. It could be a team that interacts with other teams inside the same legal entity (for example, the IT department provides services to the marketing department).</p>
<p class="noindent">It&#8217;s important to define what the term &#8216;organisation&#8217; refers to so that relationships can be identified and managed. For example, some businesses expect their IT department to behave like an external service provider organisation and to transact with the other business departments as customer organisations. Other businesses define themselves as a single organisation and see all of their internal departments working together as part of the whole organisation. There is no right or wrong way to structure these relationships, but they do need to be defined and managed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Historically, some organisations did not listen to their customers. They saw their relationship with customers as being:</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>One-directional</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Distant</p>
<p class="blista1"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Without feedback</p>
<p class="noindent">In fact, value is a two-way relationship. Value is co-created, a term that implies involvement from both the service provider organisation and the consumer.</p>
<p class="noindent">The growth of online services allows organisations to capture feedback from their customers much more easily.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, in the past, a new piece of software may have been released every 12 months, based on an aggregated set of feedback and updated requirements. Now, service provider organisations can track what buttons customers are clicking, how long they spend on a page and even where their eyes are moving. They can release software more frequently</p>
<p class="noindent">perhaps many times a day &#8211; to respond to the feedback they have been monitoring.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch01i"></a><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Co-creation</p>
<p class="noindent">Co-creation focuses on customer experience and interactive relationships. It encourages active customer involvement. Organisations need to collaborate with their customers and consumers, as well as the suppliers that help them to offer valuable services. Each product and service is part of a web of service relationships. Most organisations act as a customer and a service provider as part of service delivery: buying and selling or consuming and supplying services and service elements.</p>
<p class="noindent">For value co-creation to take place, both the consumer and the service provider organisation must get value from the product or service.</p>
<p class="noindent">For example, consider using a travel agent to book a holiday. The outcome that you (the consumer) want is the holiday of a lifetime, and the travel agent (the service provider organisation) will help you achieve this. You need to share information about your budget, desired location, activities, planned dates, etc. The travel agent will then provide you with options tailored to your requirements. They will use other service provider organisations like hotels, airlines and transfer companies to build the service for you. Together, you will create the value you want from your trip. If you, as the consumer, withhold important information from the travel agent, they are unlikely to be able to meet your needs. You receive value as the consumer, but the travel agent also receives value, perhaps through profit, repeat business and your word-of-mouth recommendations.</p>
