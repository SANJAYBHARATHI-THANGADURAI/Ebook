<p class="fm-title1">PREFACE</p>
<p class="noindent">I&#8217;ve been involved with ITIL&#174; and IT service management for more than 15 years. In that time, I&#8217;ve worked in operational and consulting roles, before setting up my own training and consulting organisations. I know from my professional and personal experience how satisfying it is when technology works, and how frustrating it can be when it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="noindent">When writing this book, I noticed that, while there are many ITSM publications available, there is still little practical guidance for the new ITSM practitioner. There is a wide range of &#8216;exam pass&#8217; guides, but these don&#8217;t add much value once your exam is complete.</p>
<p class="noindent">This book contains everything you need to know to pass the ITIL 4 Foundation Certificate, but much more as well.</p>
<p class="noindent">I&#8217;ve covered practices and concepts that are not addressed as part of the Foundation syllabus, and provided practical tips for applying service management. I&#8217;ve added to the theory by including practice considerations, based on my experiences.</p>
<p class="noindent">As you proceed through the book, you can easily see which content is related to the ITIL 4 Foundation syllabus, and which isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="noindent">Content related to the Foundation syllabus is highlighted with this symbol:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Content that is not part of the Foundation syllabus is highlighted with this symbol:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/></p>
<p class="noindent">Unless stated otherwise, all quotations are from <i>ITIL&#174; Foundation, ITIL 4 edition</i>.</p>
<p class="noindent">I wish you every success in your ITIL Foundation exam and hope you will continue to use this book as you work with IT service management in your day-to-day role.</p>
