<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Organisational governance is responsible for evaluating, directing and monitoring an organisation&#8217;s activities, including its service management.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;<i>Every organization is directed by a governing body, i.e. a person or group of people who are accountable at the highest level for the performance and compliance of the organization. All sizes and types of organization perform governance activities; the governing body may be a board of directors or executive managers how take on a separate governance role when they are performing governance activities. The governing body is accountable for the organization&#8217;s compliance with policies and any external regulations</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="bodytext"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>The level of governance within an organisation will be defined by many factors: its size, the industry sector, whether or not it is publicly listed, and the culture within which it operates.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the governing body doesn&#8217;t provide clear direction, there is a risk that managers will make decisions that are not aligned with the organisation&#8217;s overall goals. For example, consider the Volkswagen emissions scandal. Volkswagen Group&#8217;s vision is &#8220;we are a globally leading provider of sustainable mobility&#8221;, including being a &#8220;role model for environment, safety and integrity&#8221;. Clearly, this vision was not understood by the departments that were creating tests that allowed polluting vehicles onto the road &#8211; a decision that ultimately destroyed shareholder value, as well as damaging</p>
