<p class="chap-title"><a id="chapter05"></a>CHAPTER 5: THE FOUR DIMENSIONS OF SERVICE MANAGEMENT</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>The four dimensions are:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Organisations and people</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Information and technology</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Partners and suppliers</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Value streams and processes</p>
<p class="noindent">The four dimensions of service management are relevant to all elements of the Service Value System (see chapter 6). Failing to consider all four dimensions can lead to services that offer poor quality or efficiency, or may even mean services aren&#8217;t delivered at all. The four dimensions can overlap and interact in unpredictable ways and must be considered for every service. Figure 4 shows the four dimensions:</p>
<img src="../images/fig4.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>
<p class="noindent">The factors on the edge of the figure can all affect or constrain any of the four dimensions. For example, legal factors might limit in which country an organisation can store information. Any factor can affect any dimension. The factors are based on PESTEL (or PESTLE), a framework used to assess macro-environmental factors.</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>PESTEL is often used within business analysis, and assesses the environment an organisation, product or service is operating in and the impact it can have. PESTEL is described in more detail in Table 5.</p>

<td class="td2" valign="top">How might political or government actions affect an organisation, product or service? For example, consider the impact of legislation on organisations like Uber and Airbnb.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="td1" valign="top">Economic</td>
<td class="td2" valign="top">Will national or global economic performance affect a product, service or organisation? For example, a recession might mean that consumers are less willing to purchase some types of service.</td></tr>

<td class="td2" valign="top">What legislation and regulations affect an organisation, product or service? What policies does an organisation have internally? This can include areas like health and safety legislation.</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">Not considering any of the four dimensions can lead to reduced value or no value at all. For example, an organisation might focus too much on technology and neglect the people who are going to use it, leading to no value being delivered.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch05a"></a><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Dimension 1: Organizations &#38; people</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;<i>The complexity of organizations is growing, and it is important to ensure that the way an organization is structured and managed, as well as its roles, responsibilities, and systems of authority and communication, is well defined and supports its overall strategy and operating model.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">The scope of organisations and people include:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Formal organisational structures</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Culture</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Required staffing and competencies (skills)</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Roles and responsibilities</p>
<p class="noindent">Culture is an essential part of an organisation&#8217;s success or failure. Considerations include:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Trust</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Transparency</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Collaboration and shared values</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Leaders who champion values</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Coordination</p>
<p class="noindent">Some of the areas that organisations need to consider as part of this dimension include:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Management and leadership styles</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Updating skills and competencies</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Communication and collaboration</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Broad knowledge plus deep specialisation</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Common objectives</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Breaking down silos</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Organisational structure describes how roles and responsibilities are allocated and coordinated within an organisation: who does what, who reports to who, and how. Most organisations have adopted one of the following approaches to departmentalisation:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Functional structure: activities are grouped by their skills, e.g. Sales, Customer Services or Finance.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Divisional structure: activities are grouped by customer region, product or service, e.g. EMEA team, online banking versus retail banking, etc.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Matrix structure: a combination of functional and divisional, e.g. a finance expert might work on an online banking project as an advisor.</p>
<p class="noindent">Within the organisational structure, employees might also experience:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Formal or informal management: how much of their role is governed by explicit rules and regulations?</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Centralised or decentralised management: what percentage of decisions are taken by a centralised team?</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Tall or flat structures: with more or fewer levels of management and hierarchy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The type of structure an organisation adopts will depend on its environment, strategy, history, and more. There is no right or wrong structure, but it is important to ensure that it supports organisational objectives. For example, an organisation that wants to innovate quickly might struggle if it has a formal, centralised management structure. It will not be able to attract the type of employees it wants, and existing employees will find it hard to drive innovation because of the amount of approval needed for any new ideas or changes.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch05b"></a><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Dimension 2: Information &#38; technology</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;<i>When applied to the Service Value System, the information and technology dimension includes the information and knowledge necessary for the management of services, as well as the technologies required. It also incorporates the relationships between different components of the Service Value System, such as the inputs and outputs of activities and practices.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Organisations need to consider:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>What information is managed by the services?</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>What supporting information and knowledge are needed to deliver and manage the services?</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>How will the information and knowledge assets be protected, managed, archived and disposed of?</p>
<p class="noindent">Technology that supports IT-enabled services includes:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>IT architecture</p>

<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Cloud computing</p>
<p class="noindent">Technology that supports ITSM includes:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Workflow management</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Communication systems</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Inventory systems</p>

<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Artificial intelligence</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Machine learning</p>
<p class="noindent">Many IT-enabled services rely on effective information management to deliver value (for example, customer loyalty schemes or Cloud storage for photos). Information management includes the areas shown in Table 6.</p>

<p class="noindent">&#8216;Digital transformation&#8217; is a term used to describe how information technology now underpins every area of business activity. Think about your own role (and, indeed, your personal life). How reliant are you on technology? As the importance of information technology grows, so do the risks associated with it. You&#8217;ve probably read news stories about organisations that have suffered a data or security breach. These cyber security incidents can have both financial and reputational consequences.</p>
<div class="box1">
AXELOS, the owner of ITIL, has published RESILIA to help meet these challenges. RESILIA isdescribed as&#8220; a comprehensive portfolio of tools and training to help your organization achieve global best practice in cyber security.RESILIA helps embed best practice cyber security skills and behaviors throughout your organization, regardless of employees roles orresponsibilities.

<p class="noindent">&#8220;<i>The partners and suppliers dimension encompasses an organization&#8217;s relationships with other organizations that are involved in the design, development, deployment, delivery, support and/or continual improvement of services. It also incorporates contracts and other agreements between the organization and its partners or suppliers.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">The scope of the partners and suppliers dimension includes:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Service provider/service consumer relationships;</p>

<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>The importance of external suppliers in service delivery affects the skills that an ITSM professional needs. Instead of creating a product or service, the ITSM professional might be involved with contract negotiation and agreement. Instead of carrying out activities, they might be overseeing a supplier and managing the ongoing relationship. Commercial issues are more likely to arise if suppliers are chosen and contracts agreed by a procurement team that has little or no contact with the product or service teams. A procurement team might be very price-driven, leading to a contract that delivers an unacceptable level of quality. ITSM professionals need to be able to work across silos to make sure the contracts agreed meet desired outcomes.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch05d"></a><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Dimension 4: Value streams &#38; processes</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;<i>Applied to the organization and its Service Value System, the value streams and processes dimension is concerned with how the various parts of the organization work in an integrated and coordinated way to enable value creation through products and services. The dimension focuses on what activities the organization undertakes and how they are organized, as well as how the organization ensures that it is enabling value creation for all stakeholders efficiently and effectively</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">A value stream is &#8220;<i>a series of steps an organization undertakes to create and deliver products and services to consumers</i>&#8221;.</p>
<p class="noindent">Value streams and processes define the activities, workflows, controls and procedures needed to achieve agreed objectives. The scope of this dimension includes:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Activities the organisation undertakes;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>How activities are organised; and</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>How value creation is ensured for all stakeholders efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p class="noindent">An organisation needs to understand its value streams to improve its overall performance. Organisations will:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Examine work and map value streams</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Analyse streams and steps to identify waste</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Eliminate waste</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Identify improvements</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Continually optimise value streams</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Value stream mapping has many benefits. Without an understanding of its value streams, an organisation is unable to explain, measure or improve them.</p>
<p class="noindent">One benefit of value stream mapping that achieves improvements quickly is the ability to identify bottlenecks; in other words, an activity, area or process that is impeding flow. We&#8217;ll use a simple value stream to illustrate this.</p>
<p class="noindent">An organisation is mapping its value stream for the deployment of customer relationship management software to sales team members. Sales staff are complaining that the process is too slow and the delay is stopping them carrying out their roles effectively. The organisation decides to map the value stream and try to identify the bottlenecks. The steps it follows are to:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Identify all the activities and steps in the process;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Record the average time it takes to complete each step and the average wait time between each step;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Map this on a simple diagram showing value add times (time to complete each step) and wait times between steps; and</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Identify the delays that can be reduced, perhaps using the longest delay or the one that is the simplest to fix.</p>
<p class="noindent">The mapping activity produces the value stream shown in Figure 6.</p>
<img src="../images/fig6.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>
<p class="noindent">Note where the longest delay is: between the approval and the deployment. Perhaps some automation could help here?</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>The key message for processes is:</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;<i>A process is a set of activities that transforms inputs into outputs. Processes describe what is done to accomplish an objective, and well-defined processes can improve productivity within and across organizations. They are usually detailed in procedures, which outline who is involved in the process, and work instructions, which explain how they are carried out</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">A process is a set of interrelated or interacting activities that transforms inputs into outputs. Processes are designed to accomplish a specific objective. Figure 7 shows a simple example:</p>
<img src="../images/fig7.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>The word &#8216;process&#8217; has acquired some negative connotations within an IT environment. Within the DevOps community, previous versions of ITIL have sometimes been seen as bureaucratic, process-driven models that can impede flow and stop work getting done. Some organisations did treat ITIL v3 as a process &#8216;catalogue&#8217; and made it their mission to implement the full set, exactly as described in the books.</p>
<p class="noindent">It&#8217;s important to focus on having &#8216;just enough&#8217; process to get the job done. Too much process can create barriers (and lead to people avoiding a process altogether), but having no process at all can lead to chaos. Each organisation needs to adopt and adapt processes to help it meet its own organisational goals, and review processes regularly to ensure they are still efficient and effective. The updates in the ITIL 4 guidance and the focus on practices aim to revise this perception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Value streams and processes for products and services help define:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>What is the generic delivery model for the service, and how does the service work?</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>What are the value streams involved in delivering the agreed outputs of the service?</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Who, or what, performs the required service actions?</p>
