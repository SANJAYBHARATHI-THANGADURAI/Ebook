<p class="bodytext"><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>The service value chain is the central element of the SVS. It is an operating model that outlines the key activities required to respond to demand and facilitate value through products and services. The activities in the value chain are:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Plan</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Improve</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Engage</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Design and transition</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Obtain/build</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Deliver and support</p>
<p class="noindent">Figure 9 shows the service value chain:</p>
<img src="../images/fig9.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>

<p class="noindent">Activities in the chain don&#8217;t necessarily happen in a linear flow. Activities may happen in parallel, be repeated, or occur as a series of iterations. Different products, services and consumers will lead to different streams of work and different routes through the value chain. For example, developing a new application will be different from amending an existing one. These are an organisation&#8217;s value streams: combinations of practices and value chain activities that lead to value.</p>
<p class="noindent">Each value chain activity relies on inputs and creates outputs for other activities. To convert inputs into outputs, the value</p>

<p class="noindent"><sup><a id="fn1"></a><a href="#fn1-1">10</a></sup> ITIL&#174; Foundation, ITIL 4 edition, Figure 4.2.</p>
<p class="noindent">chain uses combinations of ITIL practices, which are sets of resources designed for performing certain types of work. Each activity can potentially use:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Resources</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Processes</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Skills</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Competencies</p>
<p class="noindent">from one or more ITIL practices, and from inside or outside the organisation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The activities are all interconnected. Skipping an activity, or spending less time on it than is needed, will impact the whole value chain as other activities will not receive the inputs they need.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are some key points to remember about the service value chain activities:</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Engage includes all engagement interactions &#8211; for example, with internal or external customers, suppliers, subject matter experts participating in the organisation&#8217;s value chain activities, etc. All new resources are obtained through Obtain/build.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>All planning takes place in the Plan activity.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Component, product and service creation, modification, delivery, maintenance and support are performed in an integrated way by the Design &#38; transition, Obtain/build, and Deliver &#38; support activities.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Products &#38; services, Demand and Value are SVS components, but they are not value chain activities.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch10a"></a>Activity: Plan</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>&#8220;The purpose of the Plan value chain activity is to ensure a shared understanding of the vision, current status, and improvement direction for all four dimensions and all products and services across the organization.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Information inputs into the Plan activity are used to create key outputs including improvement opportunities (for Improve) and contract agreements (for Engage).</p>
