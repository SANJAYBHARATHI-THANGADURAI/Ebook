<p class="fm-title1">FOREWORD</p>
<p class="noindent">Congratulations! You are now in possession of a book that will prove to be of great value to IT professionals at different stages in their IT service management journey: from the ITIL&#174; greenhorns to the veterans looking to solidify their status.</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>ITIL 4 Essentials</i> has been written with a delightfully refreshing approach, one that combines theoretical knowledge with practical know-how, arising from the author&#8217;s real-world experience. The author has also painstakingly marked out sections that are specific to the ITIL 4 Foundation certification exam as an easy reference for those who intend to attempt it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Large volumes of theory can often be exhausting and at times uninteresting. One of the standout features in <i>ITIL 4 Essentials</i> is how the author overcomes this by encouraging active participation from the reader through the &#8216;Have a go&#8217; exercises wherever appropriate. The &#8216;Practice considerations&#8217; that have been documented add tremendous value to anyone looking to implement various aspects of ITIL 4, as the author shares her real-world concerns and constraints.</p>
<p class="noindent">For those new to ITIL 4, the Service Value System has been covered extensively, with particular emphasis on &#8216;The 7 guiding principles&#8217; and the &#8216;34 ITIL practices&#8217;.</p>
<p class="noindent">This book is a must-have item on your desk for its simplicity in presentation, thoroughness in detail and pragmatism in approach.</p>
