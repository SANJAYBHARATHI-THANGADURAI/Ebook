<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/re.jpg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>A guiding principle is a &#8220;<i>recommendation that guides an organization in all circumstances</i>&#8221;.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many things change in day-to-day operations:</p>

<p class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>xsManagement and organisational structure</p>
<p class="noindent">Guiding principles remain constant, no matter what else changes. Using guiding principles allows organisations to integrate multiple ways of working and management methods within service management. For example, some organisations follow a waterfall way of working, while others use methods like Agile and DevOps. The principles allow different ways of working to be used, while making sure appropriate outcomes are delivered.</p>

<p class="noindent">The guiding principles should encourage and support continual improvement. They apply across the organisation at all levels and all staff should be aware of them. In each situation, staff and organisations should consider their principles and what is applicable. Not all principles are relevant in every situation, but they all need to be reviewed on each occasion to assess if they are appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent">The ITIL guiding principles are:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span> Focus on value</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span> Start where you are</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span> Progress iteratively with feedback</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span> Collaborate and promote visibility</p>

<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>The ITIL authors recommend putting up posters of the guiding principles in your workplace and meeting rooms to help remind everyone to focus on them. Why not try it?</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch08a"></a><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Guiding principle 1: Focus on value</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;<i>Everything the organization does should link back, directly or indirectly, to value for itself, its customers, and other stakeholders</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Services that offer value are attractive to customers. Services must also offer value to the service provider organisation. &#8216;Focus on value&#8217; can include:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Understanding and identifying the service consumer;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Understanding the consumer&#8217;s perspective of value;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Mapping value to intended outcomes, and understanding these can change over time; and</p>

<p class="block"><sup><a id="fn1"></a><a href="#fn1-1">7</a></sup><i>VeriSM&#8482;: Unwrapped and Applied</i>, 2018, C. Agutter, J. Botha and S.D. Van Hove, Van Haren Publishing.</p>
<p class="noindent">As part of service provision, organisations need to know:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Why consumers use services;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>What the services help them to do (the outcomes they support);</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>How services help them achieve goals;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>The cost to the consumer; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>The risks for the consumer.</p>
<p class="noindent">To successfully apply this principle, service provider organisations need to consider:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>How consumers use each service;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>How to encourage all of their staff to focus on value;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>How to maintain a focus on value in day-to-day operations, not just as an improvement project; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>How to embed focus on value in every single improvement initiative.</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>An organisation&#8217;s employees can only focus on value if they understand what value looks like for their particular organisation as well as its consumers. Does an organisation value profit above everything else? Does it value long-term customer relationships, or perhaps being seen as an innovator?</p>
<p class="noindent">In organisations with many layers of management and a hierarchical structure, &#8216;value&#8217; might only be understood at senior levels. Frontline workers may be seen as less important and so &#8216;value&#8217; isn&#8217;t communicated to them. Adopting a flatter structure with fewer layers of management can help to communicate key concepts like &#8216;value&#8217; to all employees so that they can work effectively.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch08b"></a><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Guiding principle 2: Start where you are</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;<i>In the process of eliminating old, unsuccessful methods or services and creating something better, there can be a great temptation to remove what has been done in the past and build something completely new. This is rarely necessary, or a wise decision. This approach can be extremely wasteful, not only in terms of time, but also in terms of the loss of existing services, processes, people and tools that could have significant value in the improvement effort. Do not start over without first considering what is already available to be leveraged</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Change can be an evolution or a revolution. Revolution is more disruptive and can have unforeseen negative consequences. Before making any change or improvement, it&#8217;s important to assess the current position and see if anything can be reused or built on.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8216;Start where you are&#8217; can include:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Assess where you are;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Observe current services, processes and methods; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Use measurements to analyse what is being observed; remember that measuring can affect the results of what is measured.</p>
<p class="noindent">To apply this principle successfully, service provider organisations need to consider:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Being as objective as possible about what exists currently;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Assessing whether current practices and services can/should be replicated or expanded;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Using risk management skills to support decision making; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Recognising that sometimes nothing from the current state can be reused.</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Measurement is described as being particularly important for this principle. What to measure, and how, is a challenge for many organisations.</p>
<p class="noindent">For IT-enabled products and services, measurement must be considered as part of the design process. It is much more difficult (and often costlier) to try to retrofit measurement after a product or service is live and in use.</p>
<p class="noindent">Measurement, then, needs to be reviewed continually for usefulness. Are the right people getting the right information to make the right decisions? If not, what needs to change?</p>
<p class="noindent">Some technical organisations are embracing the concept of &#8216;observability&#8217;.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#8220;Observability is achieved when a system is understandable, which is difficult in today&#8217;s world of increasing software complexity, where most problems are the convergence of many different things failing at once.</p>
<p class="noindent">One early definition of software observability focused on the three so-called &#8220;pillars&#8221; of logs, metrics, and traces. That was a good first effort at shifting the priorities of the industry, but the definition is flawed.</p>
<p class="noindent">A better and more contemporary litmus test for observability is: can you ask the right questions? And can you do it in a way that&#8217;s predictable, fast, and scalable over time &#8211; i.e., without having to re-instrument or launch new code?&#8221;8</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch08c"></a>Guiding principle 3: Progress iteratively with feedback</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/><i>&#8220;Resist the temptation to do everything at once. Even huge initiatives must be accomplished iteratively. By organizing work into smaller, manageable sections that can be executed and completed in a timely manner, the focus on each effort will be sharper and easier to maintain.&#8221;</i></p>
<p class="noindent">Feedback can help service provider organisations to understand:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>End-user and customer perception of value;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>The efficiency and effectiveness of their services and value chain;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>The effectiveness of governance and management controls;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>The interfaces between the organisation and suppliers and partners;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Demand for products and services; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Improvement opportunities, risks and issues.</p>
<p class="noindent">Working iteratively and using feedback help service provider organisations to be more:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Flexible;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Responsive to changing requirements;</p>

<p class="noindent">8<a href="http://www.honeycomb.io/obeservability/."><i>www.honeycomb.io/observability.</i></a></p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Capable of identifying and responding to failures; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Quality-focused.</p>
<p class="noindent">To successfully apply this principle, service provider organisations need to consider:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Comprehending the whole, but doing <i>something</i>; starting small;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>That the ecosystem is always changing, so feedback is essential; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Going fast doesn&#8217;t mean work is incomplete; iterations may be small, but they are still producing results.</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>How do we know if feedback is meaningful or accurate? Some service provider organisations dismiss feedback if they feel that it represents a dissatisfied minority. It is true that tools like customer satisfaction surveys are often completed by customers who feel either extremely positive or extremely negative about their experience. Service providers need to follow the basics of statistical sampling and avoid biased sampling techniques.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch08d"></a>Guiding principle 4: Collaborate and promote visibility</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>&#8220;<i>When initiatives involve the right people in the correct roles, efforts benefit from better buy-in, more relevance (because better information is available for decision- making) and increased likelihood of long term success</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Collaboration can be viewed as working together towards a shared goal. It can help to remove silos within organisations, allowing everyone to work together more effectively. Collaboration can happen anywhere &#8211; inside and outside ofthe organisation (for example, with other internal teams, or with external suppliers).</p>
<p class="noindent">Promoting visibility makes work more transparent in the organisation. This helps everyone to:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Understand what is a priority;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Balance improvement work and daily work;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Understand the flow of work;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Understand where there are bottlenecks; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Identify where time, resources and money are being wasted.</p>
<p class="noindent">To apply this principle successfully, service provider organisations need to consider that:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Collaboration does not mean consensus; it&#8217;s not essential that everyone agrees, but everyone must understand why decisions are made;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Communication must match the audience; different stakeholder groups will need a different message and communication type; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Good decisions can only be made when there is visible data to support them.</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Collaboration won&#8217;t just &#8216;happen&#8217;. The leaders within a service provider organisation need to create an environment where collaboration can thrive and be rewarded.</p>
<p class="noindent">Collaboration thrives in high trust environments, which are characterised by:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Good communication;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Support between individuals;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Respect;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Fairness; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Predictability</p>
<p class="noindent">Think about your own organisation, and whether it is ready for more collaborative working. What might need to change?</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch08e"></a>Guiding principle 5: Think and work holistically</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>&#8220;<i>No service, practice, process, department or supplier stands alone. The outputs that the organization delivers to itself, its customers and other stakeholders will suffer unless it works in an integrated way to handle its activities as a whole, rather than separate parts. All the organization&#8217;s activities should be focused on the delivery of value</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">To apply this principle successfully, service provider organisations need to consider that:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>The complexity of the system will affect how this principle is applied; higher complexity can create challenges;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Collaboration supports holistic thinking and working;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Automation can support holistic working; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Patterns in the needs of and interactions between system elements can help identify the holistic viewpoint.</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Much recent management thinking has focused on functional specialisation. Value streams are divided into tasks, and resources are directed towards completing one individual task in as near a perfect way as possible. For example, think about a fast-food outlet, with one team member preparing fries, one assembling burgers, one serving customers, etc. This can be highly effective, but also adds a risk that team members lose sight of the big picture. If the team member assembling the burgers decides to save time by leaving out the pickle (thinking that no one likes it anyway!), they create problems for the team member serving customers, who has to deal with complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent">Think about your own role and your team&#8217;s role within your organisation. How do you and your team fit into the big picture?</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch08f"></a>Guiding principle 6: Keep it simple and practical</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>&#8220;<i>Always use the minimum number of steps to accomplish an objective. Outcome-based thinking should be used to produce practical solutions that deliver valuable outcomes</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Processes and services are designed to meet the majority of consumers&#8217; needs. Every exception cannot be designed for. It is better to create rules that can be used to handle exceptions when necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent">To successfully apply this principle, service provider organisations need to:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Ensure value comes from every activity;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Recognise that simplicity can be more challenging to create than complexity;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Do fewer things; do them better;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Respect people&#8217;s time; don&#8217;t make them do unnecessary work;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Consider that simplicity can support quick wins; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Remember that processes or services that are easy to understand are more likely to be used.</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>In the DevOps community, process is sometimes described as the &#8216;scar tissue&#8217; that organisations develop over time (first described by Bridget Kromhout). What this statement describes is the way that an organisation will add extra steps and checks and balances each time something goes wrong, to try to prevent the same situation happening in future. For example, a software patch that has been manually tested might fail in the live environment. In response, an automated test is added and a requirement for sign-off from a test manager. If the patch fails again, sign-off might also be added from a change manager or the application owner. Unintentionally, organisations add complexity to how they work, which can lead to the unintended outcome of employees circumventing the process entirely. This principle is advising us to continually reassess how we work, and look for ways to make things simpler, without compromising value.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch08g"></a>Guiding principle 7: Optimize and automate</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/re.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>&#8220;<i>Organizations must maximize the value of the work carried out by their human and technical resources. The four dimensions model provides a holistic view of the various constraints, resource types, and other areas that should be considered when designing, managing, or operating an organization. Technology can help organizations to scale up and take on frequent and repetitive tasks, allowing human resources to be used for more complex decision making. However, technology should not always be relied upon without the capability of human intervention, as automation for automation&#8217;s sake can increase costs and reduce organizational robustness and resilience</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Optimisation means &#8220;<i>to make something as effective and useful as it needs to be. Before an activity can be effectively automated, it should be optimized to whatever degree is possible and reasonable.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p class="noindent">Automation typically refers to &#8220;<i>the use of technology to perform a step or series of steps correctly and consistently with limited or no human intervention human intervention</i>&#8221;.</p>
<p class="noindent">Optimisation activities include:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Understanding and agreeing the context for optimisation;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Assessing the current state;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Agreeing the future state and prioritise, focusing on simplification and value;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Ensuring stakeholder engagement and commitment;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Executing improvements iteratively; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Monitoring the impact of optimisation continually.</p>
<p class="noindent">It&#8217;s important to simplify and/or optimise activities before automation is attempted.</p>
<p class="noindent">Automation can include:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Focusing on simplification and optimisation before automation;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Defining metrics to measure impact and value; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Using complementary guiding principles:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#959;</span>Progress iteratively with feedback</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#959;;</span>Keep it simple and practical</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#959;</span>Focus on value</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#959;</span>Start where you are</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch08h"></a>The benefits of automation</p>
<p class="noindent"><img src="../images/ea.jpg" class="svg" alt="image" style="height:100%; text-align:center;"/>Once a task or process has been introduced and performed regularly, often, the next step is to try to automate it. Automation can improve the performance of people, processes, management and organisation structures. It can also improve the way that knowledge and information are shared between parts of the organisation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Automation can improve the utility and warranty of services, for example:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Automated resources can have their capacity adjusted more easily;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Automated resources don&#8217;t need human intervention, so can be available across time zones or service hours;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Automated systems can be measured more effectively and improved;</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Computers can optimise services and processes in ways that humans could not; and</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Automation can capture knowledge about a process and share it more easily.</p>
<p class="noindent">Used carefully, automation can improve service quality and reduce costs and risks. It does this by removing the human element and minimising the chances of a task being performed in different ways by different people.</p>
<p class="noindent">Automation should reduce complexity and uncertainty. To be automated, a task or process must be clearly defined and understood, or the automation will fail.</p>
<p class="chapter-h"><a id="ch08i"></a>Getting ready to automate</p>
<p class="noindent">Automation will only work if the task or process is broken down into logical steps as part of a workflow that can be programmed into the relevant tool.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are four main areas to consider when looking at automation:</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="ch08j"></a><b>Service management automation</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Most service management practices will benefit from some level of automation. For example, incident management works well when incident information can be captured and easily transferred between teams. Incident management tools can also automatically notify someone when they are about to breach a target, and something needs to be escalated.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are many service management tools available, aimed at small, medium and large organisations. Selecting the correct tool can be a real challenge.</p>
<p class="noindent">When selecting a tool, remember these key points:</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Invest time in requirements gathering, including analysis of your existing toolset; it will pay off.</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Create a long list of available options.</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Carry out a paper review.</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Create a short list and invite suppliers in to demonstrate.</p>
<P class="blist"><span class="space1">&#8226;</span>Select the tool most closely aligned with your budget and requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent">Every organisation will have different requirements for a service management toolset, but there are some generic considerations, as shown in Table 10.</p>
<p class="center">Table 10: Generic Service Management Toolset Requirements</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td class="td1" valign="top">Generic toolset requirement</td>
<td class="td1" valign="top">Considerations</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="td" valign="top">Self-help</td>
<td class="td2" valign="top">Self-help allows users to access a range of services without speaking directly to someone in the IT department. It is often offered via a web front-end, which needs to connect directly to back-end process handling software.Self-help technology integrates these user requests into the back-end process management software so that they can be treated in a consistent manner. Using technology and automation in this way can mean, for example, that fewer people are required on the service desk answering the phone, and phone calls could be limited t service emergencies and high-priority incidents.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="td" valign="top">Workflow/process engine</td>
<td class="td2" valign="top">Automation of workflows and process flows helps ensure that less manual intervention is required when information is passed from team to team, or person to person.
Responsibilities, mandatory activities and escalation points can also be programmed into a tool with workflow management&#45;so that these are managed automatically too.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="td" valign="top">Integrated configuration management system(CMS)</td>
<td class="td2" valign="top">An integrated CMS allows information about specific configuration items to be accessed at any time. Configuration items can be linked to incidents, problems,changes and known errors&#45; all via the integrated CMS. (See chapter 11 for more information about configuration management.)</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="td" valign="top">Discovery/deployment/licensing</td>
<td class="td2" valign="top">Automated discovery tools dramatically ease the task of updating and changing data in a CMS.Automatically discovering every configuration item on the network means only non-networked configuration items will need to be discovered manually and recorded. This removes the danger of people making mistakes during the population of the CMS and allows 
ongoing verification of the data.
<p class="noindent">Any unauthorised changes made to a configuration item will be quickly picked up by the discovery software. This means you can prevent unauthorised itemsbeing connected to the network, as well as 
identifying any configuration items that 
disappear without approval.</p>
<p class="noindent">Discovery technology can also be used to deploy software packages.This helps the organisation to keep track of its software licensing position, as software installs can quickly be compared to thenumber of licences entered in the CMS.</p>
<p class="noindent">An interface to self-help facilities can also be provided via the toolset, to allow request and download of approved software. If this is automatically handled by the deployment software, the service request can be fulfilled with no humanintervention, againsaving resources.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="td" valign="top">Remote 
control</td>
<td class="td2" valign="top">Remote contro allows an agent to operate an end user&#39;s PCfrom another location.</p>
<p class="noindent">With remote control, the service desk can resolve more incidents at the first point of user contact.Remote-control facilities involve security implications, and these will need to be considered carefully. The organisation might, for example, require a user to click to accept an agent having access to their PC.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="td" valign="top">Diagnostic 
utilities</td>
<td class="td2" valign="top">Diagnostic utilities include specially written scripts, routines and programs that are executed to analyse information quickly and provide feedback, typically to help diagnose or record an incident.
Within many support organisations, second-line support teams are often critical of thequality of information passed to them by the service desk. Involving these teams in the preparation of diagnostic utilities and scripts means the incident management process can be made more efficient by ensuring that the correct level of information is collected first time.
Utilities and scripts will also need to be regularly audited to make sure they are still up to date and fit for purpose.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="td" valign="top">Reporting</td>
<td class="td2" valign="top">All service management tools should come with some pre-programmed reports that you can leverage quickly, as well as the option to create your own reports &#45;these should be tailored to your organisation and the specific targets youhave to meet.
Effective reporting is vital to service management, so any data entered into a toolsetshould be easy to manipulate and review.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td class="td" valign="top">Dashboards</td>
<td class="td2" valign="top">Dashboards provide instant information about service management. For example, a dashboard can allow service level agreement target breaches to be identified quickly and appropriate actiontaken. Many organisations already use dashboards, often with red-amber-green colours signifying certain conditions. Dashboards can be used within IT or made aavailable to customers.</td></tr>
